# Gazebo2018
Holds our Gazebo files for the FRC Power Up Competition

Clone this repo into your `~/.gazebo/models` directory (because Gazebo only reads models from certain paths, and even if you add extra paths, it will copy models to the default path and not pick up future updates).

To start the world in Gazebo:

```
gazebo --pause ~/.gazebo/models/Gazebo2018/world.world
```
